# RPC

This is Rich Presence for Discord.

## Get It Working

-   Create an app from: https://discord.com/developers/applications
-   Click your app and copy your `APPLICATION ID`
-   Paste app id to `.env` file (without <>)
-   Change `activityObj` properties for yourself(index.js)
-   Type cmd/console to `npm install -g pkg`, `npm install`, `npm run exec`
-   Open the `dc-rpc.exe` (make sure discord is open before opening exe)

If the console closes as soon as it opens, check your `activityObj`. Probably your images are causing problem. You can use Rich Presence Art Assets. Upload your images to Rich Presence Art Assets section and name it then just insert image names to image key areas.
